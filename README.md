# HTTP Error Pages
This repo contains modern-looking dark-mode-ready HTTP error pages written in HTML and styled using a single CSS file.

## Get started
Simply clone this repo, put the files into the directory of your liking, replace `%home_url%` in all files with your own home URL and get going.  
Optionally, you can change the `style.css` link in every `<head>` section to match your folder structure.  
After that, set up your server to serve the pages upon encountering an error and **you're good to go**!
